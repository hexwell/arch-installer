- Chocolatey Windows auto installer (now windows has it's own package manager, maybe look into that)
- Windows version of arch installer usb creator, made with dd from the git chocolatey package
  - There is dd in git for windows (cygwin)
  - How to have wget in git for Windows:
      Download: https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/
      Into: C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\

- Make a script to install Arch in dual boot w/ Windows, with disk ecnrytpion. Bootloader TBD

================================================================================================

Missing features:

- Automatically clone dotfiles repo
- fprint (fingerprint reader authentication support)
- Automatic swap size calculation
- Having precompiled arch-installer config files in dotfiles repo

Could improve:

- Clipboard persistence
- Better formatting and encryption

TODO:

- Move NetworkManager installation to desktop.bash?
- Network? Maybe remove from desktop and also install. Rethink everything. Add static IP to wifi & extract common/shared code.
- Review config files, try to remove from home
- Create a function for format_and_mount?
- Wait in a better way for network (-> nm-online), Reflector & ioctl (-> partprobe)
- Clean up aur user & aur-install?
- chown $USER .config
- once the text editor is decided, maybe remove Emacs from bashrc (in dotfiles)

TODO:
Have a look at config directories (.d) for all configurations that are modified in arch-installer.
You could have single files that override the main config there, instead of modifying the main config.
(See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47407448/linux-configuration-files-names-with-numbers)
Moreover, you could modify only the user's config and not the system-wide config.

For example (from https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/NetworkManager.conf.html):
If a default NetworkManager.conf is provided by your distribution's packages, you should not modify it, since your changes may get overwritten by package updates. Instead, you can add additional .conf files to the /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d directory. These will be read in order, with later files overriding earlier ones. Packages might install further configuration snippets to /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d. This directory is parsed first, even before NetworkManager.conf. Scripts can also put per-boot configuration into /run/NetworkManager/conf.d. This directory is parsed second, also before NetworkManager.conf. The loading of a file /run/NetworkManager/conf.d/name.conf can be prevented by adding a file /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/name.conf. Likewise, a file /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/name.conf can be shadowed by putting a file of the same name to either /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d or /run/NetworkManager/conf.d.
