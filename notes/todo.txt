- Chocolatey Windows auto installer (now windows has it's own package manager, maybe look into that)
- Windows version of arch installer usb creator, made with dd from the git chocolatey package
  - There is dd in git for windows (cygwin)
  - How to have wget in git for Windows:
      Download: https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/
      Into: C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\

- Make a script to install Arch in dual boot w/ Windows, with disk ecnrytpion. Bootloader TBD

================================================================================================

Missing features:

- Automatically clone dotfiles repo
- fprint (fingerprint reader authentication support)
- Automatic swap size calculation
- Having precompiled arch-installer config files in dotfiles repo

Could improve:

- Clipboard persistence
- Better formatting and encryption

TODO:

- Move NetworkManager installation to desktop.bash?
- Network? Maybe remove from desktop and also install. Rethink everything. Add static IP to wifi & extract common/shared code.
- Review config files, try to remove from home
- Create a function for format_and_mount?
- Wait in a better way for network (-> nm-online), Reflector & ioctl (-> partprobe)
- Clean up aur user & aur-install?
- chown $USER .config
- once the text editor is decided, maybe remove Emacs from bashrc (in dotfiles)
